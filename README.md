# Arduino Projects - Real-Time OS and Ubiquitous Computing

This repository contains Arduino projects created during my Erasmus semester at HTWG Konstanz (Germany) for the course **Real-Time Operating Systems and Ubiquitous Computing**. 
The projects focus on real-time computing concepts and practical implementations using the Arduino platform, specifically the Arduino Nano RP2040.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, youâ€™ll need:
1. **Arduino IDE** or another compatible IDE, configured for the Arduino Nano RP2040.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lauraDascalu/Arduino-Projects.git
3. Open the project of your choice in the Arduino IDE and upload it to the Arduino Nano RP2040.
